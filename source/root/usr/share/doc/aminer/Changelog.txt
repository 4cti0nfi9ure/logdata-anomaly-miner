V0.0.7 (2016-12-07):
====================

* New features:
  * Datetime parsing reimplemented in DateTimeModelElement to
    fix various shortcomings of strptime in Python and libc.


V0.0.6 (2016-11-04):
====================

* New features:
  * Added "LogAtom" and "AtomHandlerInterface" to pass data from
    IO-layer to upper layers consistently.
  * Added TimestampsUnsortedDetector.py to fail (exit) when data
    is not properly sorted.
  * Added SimpleMultisourceAtomSync.py to merge LogAtoms read
    from parallel streams, e.g. from multiple logfiles.
* Bugfixes:
  * Logic flaw in logfile rollover handling, selecting on bad fd.
  * Unassigned, reused variable caused same logfile to be opened
    more than once.

V0.0.5 (2016-10-11):
====================

* New features:
  * Added helper class for parser matching process debugging.
  * Added interface to ease detector state updates after triggering
    an event.
  * Added minimal model for parsing Tomcat start/stop syslog messages.
  * Added support for logfile reading continuation after shutdown,
    alternative lowlevel data stream splitting tools (atomizers).
* Bugfixes:
  * Fixed file descriptor leak in PersistencyUtil.py on store.


V0.0.4 (2016-08-26):
====================

* New features:
  * NewMatchPathValueComboDetector: Detect new combination of
    values for list of data pathes, e.g. for link analysis.
  * ParsedAtomFilterMatchAction: Forward data to specific handlers
    when rules match.
  * VolatileLogarithmicBackoffEventHistory: Added unique EventId
  * Pass event source reference to event handlers to allow query/change
    of source parameters when handling the event.
  * Generic logdata parsing model improvements
  * Added new rule types: ValueDependentDelegatedMatchRule and
    ValueDependentModuloTimeMatchRule
* Bugfixes:
  * Packaging: unowned directory after purge, see
    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832347
  * DefaultMailNotificationEventHandler: cleanup of old sendmail
    process instances not working
  * EventGenerationMatchAction: wrong method name, class field access


V0.0.3 (2016-07-21):
====================

* Backport of changes from Debian ITP process review, see
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813096
* Handle rollover from one logfile to the next more graceful.
* New features:
  * Added support for multiple parallel timescales in component
    trigger timing, e.g. real-time and forensic-time.
  * Added MissingMatchPathValueDetector to detect when data values
    were not reported for an extended period of time.
  * Added VolatileLogarithmicBackoffEventHistory to keep data
    of limited number of events in memory for automated processing.
  * AMinerRemoteControl: Added "--ExecFile" parameter to execute
    commands from file, "--StringResponse" for direct output.
* Bugfixes:
  * debian/postinst: disable service start when not already enabled
    using standard methods debian/rules and debian/postinst.


V0.0.2 (2016-05-12):
====================

* Added remote control support, command line tool for sending
  commands.
* Added AnalysisContext as registry for analysis components and
  access point for remote control.
* Added component to write events to syslog (read component documentation
  for CAVEATs)
* Package structure fixes from Debian mentoring procedure
* Bugfixes:
  * ModuloTimeMatchRule: time object path was ignored on error
  * Indent-formatting repaired, single-line mode added


V0.0.1 (2016-04-07):
====================

* Bugfixes
* Minor feature improvements (options)
* New features:
  * MultiLocaleDateTimeModelElement: decode timestamps not encoded
    using local system language or byte encoding.
  * ParsedAtomFilters: filter received atoms and filter to other handlers
  * TimestampCorrectionFilters: Correct timestamps from broken
    sources to have monotonic time.

V0.0.0 (2016-03-04):
====================

Initial Release Features:

* Common parsing model elements available: fixed strings, numbers,
  IP addresses, date-time fields, delimited fields, fixed alphabet
   fields, ...
* Common parsing model structural elements: sequences, branches,
  repeated elements, optional elements.
* Stream and file reading, splitting into lines.
* Operating system integration: privileged parent process forwarding
  file descriptors to analysis child.
* Reopening of log files using open/fstat loop.
* Functionality for state persistence handling between restarts.
* Analysis components:
  * NewMatchPathDetector: generate events when new match path
    is detected.
  * HistogramAnalysis: generate complete and path-dependent histograms
    for given properties.
  * MatchValueQueueSplitter: split input from e.g. one parser
    and forward it to different analyzers depending on match values.
  * WhitelistViolationDetector: ignore log data that is whitelisted
    at least by single rule (logcheck equivalent behaviour)
  * TimeCorrelationViolationDetector: check if usually correlated
    loglines are really found both.
