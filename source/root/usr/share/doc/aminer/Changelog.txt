* Backport of changes from Debian ITP process review, see
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813096
* Handle rollover from one logfile to the next more graceful
* Added MissingMatchPathValueDetector to detect when data values
  were not reported for an extended period of time.


V0.0.2 (2016-05-12):
====================

* Added remote control support, command line tool for sending
  commands.
* Added AnalysisContext as registry for analysis components and
  access point for remote control.
* Added component to write events to syslog (read component documentation
  for CAVEATs)
* Package structure fixes from Debian mentoring procedure
* Bugfixes:
  * ModuloTimeMatchRule: time object path was ignored on error
  * Indent-formatting repaired, single-line mode added


V0.0.1 (2016-04-07):
====================

* Bugfixes
* Minor feature improvements (options)
* New features:
  * MultiLocaleDateTimeModelElement: decode timestamps not encoded
    using local system language or byte encoding.
  * ParsedAtomFilters: filter received atoms and filter to other handlers
  * TimestampCorrectionFilters: Correct timestamps from broken
    sources to have monotonic time.

V0.0.0 (2016-03-04):
====================

Initial Release Features:

* Common parsing model elements available: fixed strings, numbers,
  IP addresses, date-time fields, delimited fields, fixed alphabet
   fields, ...
* Common parsing model structural elements: sequences, branches,
  repeated elements, optional elements.
* Stream and file reading, splitting into lines.
* Operating system integration: privileged parent process forwarding
  file descriptors to analysis child.
* Reopening of log files using open/fstat loop.
* Functionality for state persistence handling between restarts.
* Analysis components:
  * NewMatchPathDetector: generate events when new match path
    is detected.
  * HistogramAnalysis: generate complete and path-dependent histograms
    for given properties.
  * MatchValueQueueSplitter: split input from e.g. one parser
    and forward it to different analyzers depending on match values.
  * WhitelistViolationDetector: ignore log data that is whitelisted
    at least by single rule (logcheck equivalent behaviour)
  * TimeCorrelationViolationDetector: check if usually correlated
    loglines are really found both.
