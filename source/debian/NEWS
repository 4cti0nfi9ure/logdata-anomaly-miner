logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.3) xenial; urgency=low

  Following API changes were introduced:

  * To improve readability of configuration files, main parser,
    analysis and event classes were added to the submodule namespaces.
    After imports directly from the submodule, e.g.
    "from aminer.parsing import FixedDataModelElement",
    the name duplication "FixedDataModelElement.FixedDataModelElement"
    is not required any more, "FixedDataModelElement" is sufficient.
    Use "sed -i -e 's/Name.Name/Name/g' [files]" to adapt.

  * Component timing was restructured to allow forensic/realtime
    triggering. Therefore also clean interface was added, which
    is now also used to reduce redundant code in component registration.
    Old way:

    analysisContext.registerComponent(newMatchPathDetector,
      componentName=None, registerAsRawAtomHandler=False,
      registerAsTimeTriggeredHandler=True)

    New way:

    analysisContext.registerComponent(newMatchPathDetector,
      registerAsRawAtomHandler=False)

    For own custom time-triggered components, make sure to implement
    the "aminer.util.TimeTriggeredComponentInterface". Use any standard
    component, e.g. "/usr/lib/logdata-anomaly-miner/aminer/analysis/NewMatchPathDetector.py"
    as example.

  * Introduction of "AnalysisContext" to have common handle for
    all data required to perform the analysis. Therefore also
    the signature of "buildAnalysisPipeline" in "config.py/analysis.py"
    has changed from

    def buildAnalysisPipeline(aminerConfig):

    to

    def buildAnalysisPipeline(analysisContext):

    Old references to "aminerConfig" within the configuration
    script have to be replaced by "analysisContext.aminerConfig".
