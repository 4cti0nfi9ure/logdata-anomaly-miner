logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Bugfixes
  * Minor feature improvements (options)
  * New features:
    * MultiLocaleDateTimeModelElement: decode timestamps not encoded
      using local system language or byte encoding.

logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.0) xenial; urgency=low

  * Initial Release Features:
    * Common parsing model elements available: fixed strings,
      numbers, IP addresses, date-time fields, delimited fields,
      fixed alphabet fields, ...
    * Common parsing model structural elements: sequences, branches,
      repeated elements, optional elements.
    * Stream and file reading, splitting into lines.
    * Operating system integration: privileged parent process forwarding
      file descriptors to analysis child.
    * Reopening of log files using open/fstat loop.
    * Functionality for state persistence handling between restarts.
    * Analysis components:
      * NewMatchPathDetector: generate events when new match path
        is detected.
      * HistogramAnalysis: generate complete and path-dependent
        histograms for given properties.
      * MatchValueQueueSplitter: split input from e.g. one parser
        and forward it to different analyzers depending on match
        values.
      * WhitelistViolationDetector: ignore log data that is whitelisted
        at least by single rule (logcheck equivalent behaviour)
      * TimeCorrelationViolationDetector: check if usually correlated
        loglines are really found both.
