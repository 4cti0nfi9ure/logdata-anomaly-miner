logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.7~pre2) xenial; urgency=low

  New features:
  * Datetime parsing reimplemented in DateTimeModelElement to
    fix various shortcomings of strptime in Python and libc.
  * ElementValueBranchModelElement added to support conditional
    branching.
  * DebugHistoryMatchRule added: keep history of matched LogAtoms.
  * Unix socket input support: improved logdata reading now also
    supporting connects to UNIX server sockets for reading.

logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.6) xenial; urgency=low

  New features:
  * Added "LogAtom" and "AtomHandlerInterface" to pass data from
    IO-layer to upper layers consistently.
  * Added TimestampsUnsortedDetector.py to fail (exit) when data
    is not properly sorted.
  * Added SimpleMultisourceAtomSync.py to merge LogAtoms read
    from parallel streams, e.g. from multiple logfiles.

  Bugfixes:
  * Logic flaw in logfile rollover handling, selecting on bad fd.
  * Unassigned, reused variable caused same logfile to be opened
    more than once.

    * Added interface to ease detector state updates after triggering
      an event.
    * Added minimal model for parsing Tomcat start/stop syslog messages.

logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.4) xenial; urgency=low

  * New features:
    * NewMatchPathValueComboDetector: Detect new combination of
      values for list of data pathes, e.g. for link analysis.
    * ParsedAtomFilterMatchAction: Forward data to specific handlers
      when rules match.
    * VolatileLogarithmicBackoffEventHistory: Added unique EventId
    * Pass event source reference to event handlers to allow query/change
      of source parameters when handling the event.
    * Generic logdata parsing model improvements
    * Added new rule types: ValueDependentDelegatedMatchRule and
      ValueDependentModuloTimeMatchRule
  * Bugfixes:
    * Packaging: unowned directory after purge, see
      https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=832347
    * DefaultMailNotificationEventHandler: cleanup of old sendmail
      process instances not working
    * EventGenerationMatchAction: wrong method name, class field access

logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.3) xenial; urgency=low

  * Backport of changes from Debian ITP process review, see
    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813096
  * Handle rollover from one logfile to the next more graceful.
  * New features:
    * Added support for multiple parallel timescales in component
      trigger timing, e.g. real-time and forensic-time.
    * Added MissingMatchPathValueDetector to detect when data
      values were not reported for an extended period of time.
    * Added VolatileLogarithmicBackoffEventHistory to keep data
      of limited number of events in memory for automated processing.
    * AMinerRemoteControl: Added "--ExecFile" parameter to execute
      commands from file, "--StringResponse" for direct output.
  * Bugfixes:
    * debian/postinst: disable service start when not already
      enabled using standard methods debian/rules and debian/postinst.

logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.2) xenial; urgency=low

  * Added remote control support, command line tool for sending
    commands.
  * Added AnalysisContext as registry for analysis components
    and access point for remote control.
  * Added component to write events to syslog (read component
    documentation for CAVEATs)
  * Package structure fixes from Debian mentoring procedure
  * Bugfixes:
    * ModuloTimeMatchRule: time object path was ignored on error
    * Indent-formatting repaired, single-line mode added

logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Bugfixes
  * Minor feature improvements (options)
  * New features:
    * MultiLocaleDateTimeModelElement: decode timestamps not encoded
      using local system language or byte encoding.
    * ParsedAtomFilters: filter received atoms and filter to other handlers
    * TimestampCorrectionFilters: Correct timestamps from broken
      sources to have monotonic time.

logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.0) xenial; urgency=low

  * Initial Release Features:
    * Common parsing model elements available: fixed strings,
      numbers, IP addresses, date-time fields, delimited fields,
      fixed alphabet fields, ...
    * Common parsing model structural elements: sequences, branches,
      repeated elements, optional elements.
    * Stream and file reading, splitting into lines.
    * Operating system integration: privileged parent process forwarding
      file descriptors to analysis child.
    * Reopening of log files using open/fstat loop.
    * Functionality for state persistence handling between restarts.
    * Analysis components:
      * NewMatchPathDetector: generate events when new match path
        is detected.
      * HistogramAnalysis: generate complete and path-dependent
        histograms for given properties.
      * MatchValueQueueSplitter: split input from e.g. one parser
        and forward it to different analyzers depending on match
        values.
      * WhitelistViolationDetector: ignore log data that is whitelisted
        at least by single rule (logcheck equivalent behaviour)
      * TimeCorrelationViolationDetector: check if usually correlated
        loglines are really found both.
